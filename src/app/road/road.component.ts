  <p>About Me
Hi! my username is ppmontegt_27
To tell you a little about myself, I am an Industrial Designer and Business Administrator. Throughout my life I have had the opportunity to work on many small and large projects. Some years ago I started to work with cryptocurrencies and blockchain and it was something that changed my life, I have always liked to teach and share with others what I know, and when I talk about blockchain, I would truly love that everyone gets to know the benefits of the blockchain.

That’s how this project started, I want blockchain technology to reach everyone.

I hope you can join me and help me in this great project.

Regards</p>
